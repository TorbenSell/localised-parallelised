# localised-parallelised

This is the code used in the experiments of Chapter 4 of Torben Sell's PhD thesis.

In the fully localised imaging example, a parallelised blocked Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm is compared to a Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm.

In the approximately localised example, a parallelised blocked Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm (which only yields approximate results), a delayed-acceptance algorithm using parallellised local proposals, and a Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm are compared.

Please get in touch with me if you have any questions, I will make my thesis available once I can, in the meantime please reach out to me if you are interested in a draft version.
